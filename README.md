# gl-slideshow

Displays a slideshow of images.
Uses [GL Transitions](https://gl-transitions.com/) for nice transition effects between images.

Available GL Transitions gallery is [here](https://gl-transitions.com/gallery)

Initially created for the public-facing window display at [Otley MAKER SPACE](otleymakerspace.co.uk), and designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3 (as that is what we had available).
